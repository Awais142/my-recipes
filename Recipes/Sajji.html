    <h1>SAJJI</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      have made this Balochi chicken Sajji at least 30 times before I was
      confident enough to share the best version with you all! For those of you
      who donâ€™t know, Sajji is a popular dish from the Balochistan province of
      Pakistan. It is popularly made with whole lamb or chicken, or big pieces
      of lamb or goat (like the leg of a goat). These whole lambs, chickens etc
      are attached to skewers, marinated in simple spices and roasted over
      coals. They are sometimes even stuffed with rice. It is the brown
      equivalent of a standard rotisserie chicken. The Sajji turns out juicy and
      moist from the inside with a crisp skin on top!

    <p>
      And even though, conventionally Sajji is made in an open fire, you can
      still make a kickass sajji in your own homes! All you need is an oven,
      some marinade and the will to make it! In this post I am going to tackle
      Chicken Sajji, and hopefully put up a post for lamb sajji soon!
